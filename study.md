### View State and UI Routing

Explain, in your own words, what a "view state" is, and how it relates to
 front-end frameworks.

```md
A view state is a front end visual display which corrisponds to the particular state of the app as any given point in time. Its the current UI relevant to events which have been trigered.
```

### Ember Concepts

What are the essential parts of an Ember 2 application?
What changes have happened between Ember 1 and Ember 2?

```md
Routes, models, templates, components, and services. Changes include one way data flow default, refresh with changes, and lifecycle hooks for componants.
```

### Ember in Practice

In your own words, describe why someone would use Ember.

```md
It seems like its very modular and good at seperating states into isolated instences of the application and its functions.
```

### Ember and URLs

In your own words, how does Ember "stop breaking the web"?

```md
As with before, it is very good at seperation of concerns. It uses an MVC paridigm which treats individual components as modular MVC groups. This allows for more control over individual elements of an application. This specialization is largely achieved through the use of good urls.
```
